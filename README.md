## Credits
* I referred to my notes from [Traversy Media's Express.js crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE).  Super great crash course, by the way.
* When trying to determine the disconnect with my db.json file and the fs module, I came across [this helpful Stack overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36093042/how-do-i-add-to-an-existing-json-file-in-node-js).  (p.s. i was missing an essential step of parsing the json data.)
